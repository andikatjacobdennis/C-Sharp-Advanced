Certainly! Inter-process communication (IPC) using named pipes is a common method for exchanging data between processes. Below is a C# example demonstrating how to use named pipes for IPC. This example includes both a server and a client application.

### Named Pipe Server

The server application listens for connections and reads messages sent by the client.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.IO.Pipes;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace PipeServer
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            using (var pipeServer = new NamedPipeServerStream("testpipe", PipeDirection.In))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Waiting for a connection...");
                await pipeServer.WaitForConnectionAsync();
                Console.WriteLine("Client connected.");

                using (var reader = new StreamReader(pipeServer, Encoding.UTF8))
                {
                    string message = await reader.ReadLineAsync();
                    Console.WriteLine($"Received message: {message}");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Named Pipe Client

The client application connects to the server and sends a message.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.IO.Pipes;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace PipeClient
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            using (var pipeClient = new NamedPipeClientStream(".", "testpipe", PipeDirection.Out))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Connecting to server...");
                await pipeClient.ConnectAsync();
                Console.WriteLine("Connected to server.");

                using (var writer = new StreamWriter(pipeClient, Encoding.UTF8))
                {
                    writer.AutoFlush = true; // Ensure the data is sent immediately
                    await writer.WriteLineAsync("Hello from client!");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **NamedPipeServerStream:**
   - **Server:** The server creates a `NamedPipeServerStream` instance with the name "testpipe" and waits for a connection using `WaitForConnectionAsync`.
   - **Reading:** After a client connects, the server reads a line of text from the pipe and prints it to the console.

2. **NamedPipeClientStream:**
   - **Client:** The client creates a `NamedPipeClientStream` instance with the same name "testpipe" and connects to the server using `ConnectAsync`.
   - **Writing:** The client sends a line of text to the server.

### Running the Example:

1. **Start the Server:**
   - Run the `PipeServer` project to start the server. It will wait for a client to connect.

2. **Start the Client:**
   - Run the `PipeClient` project to connect to the server and send a message.

3. **Output:**
   - The server should output the message sent by the client.

### Notes:

- **Error Handling:** This example does not include detailed error handling for simplicity. In a real application, you should handle exceptions and errors appropriately.
- **Synchronization:** This example assumes a single client-server connection. For handling multiple clients or more complex scenarios, consider additional synchronization mechanisms and proper resource management.
- **Naming:** Ensure that the pipe name ("testpipe" in this example) is unique across the system to avoid conflicts with other named pipes.

This basic example demonstrates how to set up IPC using named pipes in C#. You can expand this to include more complex data exchanges and error handling as needed for your specific use case.
