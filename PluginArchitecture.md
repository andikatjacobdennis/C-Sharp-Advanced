Plugin-loading code that includes enhanced error handling, versioning checks, and basic security measures.

### Enhanced Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Reflection;
using System.Security;
using System.Security.Permissions;

public interface IPlugin
{
    void Execute();
    Version PluginVersion { get; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string pluginDirectory = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "Plugins");
        string[] pluginFiles = Directory.GetFiles(pluginDirectory, "*.dll");

        foreach (string pluginFile in pluginFiles)
        {
            try
            {
                // Security: Load the plugin assembly with restricted permissions
                var permissionSet = new PermissionSet(PermissionState.None);
                permissionSet.AddPermission(new FileIOPermission(FileIOPermissionAccess.Read | FileIOPermissionAccess.PathDiscovery, pluginFile));

                if (!permissionSet.IsSubsetOf(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.PermissionSet))
                {
                    throw new SecurityException("Insufficient permissions to load the plugin.");
                }

                // Load the plugin assembly
                Assembly assembly = Assembly.LoadFrom(pluginFile);

                // Find types that implement the IPlugin interface
                var pluginTypes = assembly.GetTypes()
                                          .Where(t => typeof(IPlugin).IsAssignableFrom(t) && !t.IsInterface && !t.IsAbstract);

                foreach (var pluginType in pluginTypes)
                {
                    try
                    {
                        // Security: Ensure that the plugin type has the required security permissions
                        var typePermissionSet = new PermissionSet(PermissionState.None);
                        if (!typePermissionSet.IsSubsetOf(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.PermissionSet))
                        {
                            throw new SecurityException("Plugin type does not have the required permissions.");
                        }

                        // Create an instance of the plugin
                        IPlugin plugin = (IPlugin)Activator.CreateInstance(pluginType);

                        // Versioning: Check if the plugin version is compatible
                        if (plugin.PluginVersion < new Version("1.0.0"))
                        {
                            throw new InvalidOperationException("Incompatible plugin version. Required version is 1.0.0 or higher.");
                        }

                        // Execute the plugin
                        plugin.Execute();
                    }
                    catch (Exception ex)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"Error executing plugin {pluginType.Name}: {ex.Message}");
                    }
                }
            }
            catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Plugin file not found: {ex.Message}");
            }
            catch (BadImageFormatException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Invalid plugin assembly format: {ex.Message}");
            }
            catch (SecurityException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Security exception: {ex.Message}");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error loading plugin {pluginFile}: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Additions

1. **Error Handling:**
   - **Try-Catch Blocks:** Added multiple try-catch blocks to handle exceptions at different stages (loading, type discovery, instantiation, execution).
   - **Specific Exceptions:** Handling of specific exceptions like `FileNotFoundException`, `BadImageFormatException`, and `SecurityException` ensures that errors are caught and reported appropriately.

2. **Versioning:**
   - **Version Check:** Added a `PluginVersion` property to the `IPlugin` interface, and a check is performed before executing the plugin to ensure that it meets the required version (e.g., `1.0.0` or higher).

   ```csharp
   public interface IPlugin
   {
       void Execute();
       Version PluginVersion { get; }
   }
   ```

   This allows the host application to ensure that only compatible plugins are loaded and executed.

3. **Security:**
   - **Permission Sets:** Introduced `PermissionSet` to enforce security constraints when loading the plugin assembly and its types.
   - **Security Exception Handling:** Security exceptions are caught and handled to ensure that untrusted or insecure plugins do not compromise the application.

4. **Isolation (Optional for Advanced Scenarios):**
   - **AppDomain/AssemblyLoadContext (for .NET Core):** If you need to go further with isolation, you can consider loading plugins in separate `AppDomain` (for older .NET versions) or `AssemblyLoadContext` (in .NET Core). This approach would allow you to unload plugins or restrict their execution context more strictly.

### Explanation

- **Error Handling:** This ensures that even if something goes wrong at any stage (like loading an assembly or executing a plugin), your application can handle it gracefully without crashing.
  
- **Versioning:** By enforcing version checks, you prevent incompatible plugins from being executed, ensuring that your application maintains stability and consistent behavior.

- **Security:** Using security checks and permission sets helps protect your application from executing potentially harmful code, especially when plugins are sourced from untrusted locations.

This code provides a more robust and secure framework for dynamically loading and managing plugins in a C# application. It also handles common real-world concerns like version compatibility and security, making it suitable for production use.
